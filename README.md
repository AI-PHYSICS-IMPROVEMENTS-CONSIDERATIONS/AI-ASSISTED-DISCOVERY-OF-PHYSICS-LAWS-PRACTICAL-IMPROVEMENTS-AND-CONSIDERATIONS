## Paper Abstract
The discovery of fundamental physics laws has traditionally required extensive human analysis of experimental data. However, as the scope of the field grows, so does the complexity and volume of the data, and, in turn, the difficulty of finding underlying physical laws and their mathematical formulations. In this study, we explored how algorithms inspired by physics properties can help discover equations from data. Specifically, we investigated how well the basic foundation laid by “AI Feynman” [1]—namely, the principle of sequential linear regression, symmetry searching, and data table transformations—can simplify and fit realistic data. We tested our system on synthetic datasets representing various polynomial and transcendental physics equations, evaluating the system’s ability to identify translational, sum, and scale symmetries, as well as its performance under noise. Our results show that the algorithm performs well on low-noise datasets and that the numerical range of data should be considered in the symmetry detection algorithm. To address the latter point, we developed an adaptive formula that could be explored even further in future research. Future work could also expand the core equation-fitting framework we have refined to deal with differential equations or higher noise levels. Overall, this work replicates from scratch the core physics-based equation-finding approach of “AI Feynman,” highlights its current limitations, tests novel improvements, and suggests directions for future efforts.
